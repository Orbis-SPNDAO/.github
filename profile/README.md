## Problem Statement

Our credit card transaction data reveal a lot about our behaviors. Aggregated together, they tell even more powerful stories about the economy. Is there a spike in Netflix subscriptions? Is there a dip in spending at hardware stores? Credit card transaction data is the highest-grossing data source in the “alternative data” market. The global alternative data market is anticipated to reach 143.31 billion USD by 2030 and is expected to grow at a 54.4% CAGR. North America alone accounted for a revenue share of more than 67.0% in 2021. 

There are more than 400 alternative data providers. Among them are credit card issuers like MasterCard and Visa, institutions like Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs, and numerous analytics firms. These businesses have been monetizing from selling purportedly anonymized and aggregated credit card transaction data and analytics services. The emergence of machine learning and AI have accelerated the growth of these services.

Despite mixed outcomes, hedge funds have spent billions of dollars acquiring such data with the hope to forecast stock performance more accurately. Google spent millions of dollars purchasing data from MasterCard, trying to link online ads to store purchases. 

However, consumers have little control over how and when their personal data, including credit card transaction data, is used. Consumers’ personal data fuels a multi-billion dollar industry while they receive almost no financial rewards. In practice, data from a single person is of little value. And there is no marketplace where consumers could coordinate and pool their data together.
